Media Buying SOP

Testing Phase:

Level 1: $30
Level 2: $60
Level 3: $120

KPIs:

2% CTR (1% min)
$1 CPC ($1.50 max)
50% ACR (40% min)
$30 CPE ($60 max)
$60 CAC ($120 max)

### Level 1: After $30 spent, analyze the data.
If ad is within KPI, let it run to $60.
If ad is out of KPI, pause it (unless you get a sale or engagement).

### Level 2: After $60 spent, analyze the data.
At this point, stats should have improved.
If ad is within KPI and we got an engagement, let it run to $120.
If ad is within KPI but we did not get an engagement, pause the ad.
If ad is out of KPI, pause the ad.

### Level 3: After $120 spent, analyze the data.
At this point, we should have a sale or 3-4 engagements.
If ad is within KPI but has no sales, turn it off.
If ad is within KPI and has no sales but it has 4+ engagements, let it run another day.
If ad has 1 or more sales, let it run another day.

Rinse and repeatâ€¦
